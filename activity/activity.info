name = SpeakAI
summary = An animated face that speaks whatever you type
description = SpeakAI is a talking face.  Anything you type will be spoken aloud using a text-to-speech model.  You can adjust the accent, rate and pitch of the voice as well as the shape of the eyes and mouth.  This is a great way to experiment with AI, learn to type or just have fun making a funny face.
